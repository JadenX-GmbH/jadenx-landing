# Supply Chain Digital Twin

## Revolutionizing Supply Chain Visibility

The Supply Chain Digital Twin (SDT) project represents a breakthrough in logistics technology, providing real-time visibility and predictive analytics for global supply chains.

## The Challenge

Traditional supply chain management systems lacked real-time visibility and predictive capabilities, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and increased operational costs.

## Our Solution

We developed a comprehensive digital twin platform that:

- **Real-time Tracking**: IoT sensors provide continuous monitoring of goods throughout the supply chain
- **Predictive Analytics**: Machine learning algorithms predict potential delays and quality issues
- **Blockchain Security**: Immutable ledger ensures data integrity and transparency
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated execution of supply chain agreements

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for responsive dashboards
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI for high-performance APIs
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum-based smart contracts
- **IoT Integration**: Custom sensor network protocols
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with time-series extensions

## Results

- **45% reduction** in supply chain delays
- **30% improvement** in inventory accuracy
- **€2.3M annual savings** through predictive maintenance
- **100% traceability** of goods from origin to destination
