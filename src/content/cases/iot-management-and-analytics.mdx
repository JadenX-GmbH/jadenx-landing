# IoT Management and Analytics Platform

## Industrial IoT Excellence

A comprehensive IoT platform for industrial equipment monitoring, predictive maintenance, and operational optimization.

## The Challenge

Manufacturing companies faced:

- Limited visibility into equipment performance
- Reactive maintenance leading to costly downtime
- Manual data collection and analysis
- Lack of real-time operational insights

## Our Solution

We developed an enterprise-grade IoT platform that provides:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live dashboard of all connected equipment
- **Predictive Maintenance**: AI-powered failure prediction
- **Automated Alerts**: Proactive notifications for maintenance needs
- **Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive reporting and insights
- **Remote Management**: Secure remote equipment control

## Technology Stack

- **IoT Edge**: Custom firmware for industrial sensors
- **Data Ingestion**: MQTT protocol with Apache Kafka
- **Time Series Database**: InfluxDB for sensor data
- **Analytics Engine**: Python with pandas and scikit-learn
- **Frontend**: React with D3.js for data visualization
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with async support
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with Kubernetes orchestration

## Key Capabilities

### Device Management
- Automatic device discovery and registration
- Firmware updates and configuration management
- Secure device authentication and authorization
- Bulk operations and group management

### Data Analytics
